# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning

## Overview

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Cleaning** project based on the Titanic dataset. The goal of this project is to explore and clean the data, uncover insights related to the survival rate of passengers, and visualize key patterns based on different features like gender, age, passenger class, and embarkation point.

The dataset used in this project is part of the famous Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle.

## Project Highlights
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables like gender, class, and age.
- Insights: Analysis on how socio-economic status, gender, and age influenced survival chances during the Titanic disaster.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
